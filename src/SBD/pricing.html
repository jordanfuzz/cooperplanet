						<b>Web Based Applications</b><br>
						This is where we would talk all about how we can provide efficient and accessible web applications.
						I'm not really sure what we would say here to fill some space, but something
						that looks good and makes people want to give us lots of money. It would have
						to be convincing and long enough to look good and really tout our Internet skills. We should encourage
						clients to
						use a web based application and discuss the adantages here. Some clients will know that they need a web
						based application, others may not see the benefits of web based for Intranet use instead of Internet use,
						but it can be helpful especially when talking about deploying and mainting the application for more than
						just one or two users. Pricing depends upon the scale and complexity of the project it will be an hourly
						rate and we could say something like: Pricing for web based applications usually ranges from $40-$50/hour.

						to be convincing and long enough to look good and really tout our Internet skills. Some clients will
						be simply looking for an application that they can use within their own office for just one or two people.
						In these cases, a client-server based app would be sensible and a web-based app wouldn't really make sense.
